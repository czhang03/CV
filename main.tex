\cventry{2020 --- Now}
{Algebraic Formulation Of Incorrectness Logic}
{Boston University Department of Computer Science}{Boston, MA}{}
{Investigates the support that KAT provides for reasoning about \emph{incorrectness}, 
as embodied by Ohearn's recently proposed incorrectness logic. 
We show that KAT cannot directly express incorrectness logic. 
To address this issue, we study Kleene algebra with Top and Tests (TopKAT), 
an extension of KAT with a top element. 
We show that TopKAT is powerful enough to express a codomain operation, 
to express incorrectness triples, 
and to prove all the rules of incorrectness logic sound. 
This shows that one can reason about the incorrectness of while-like programs 
by means of the equational theory of TopKAT\@. }

{Mathematics Honor Thesis}
{Wheaton College Mathematics Department}
{Norton, MA}{}
{Studied kings in generalizations of tournament,
with a special focus on quasi-transitive oriented graphs.
I have shown that all the quasi-transitive oriented graphs
can be condensed into a tournament via tie component condensation, 
and tie component condensation of quasi-transitive 
oriented graphs is the most efficient condensation to tournament.

{Software Lead}
{Lexomics Research Group, Wheaton College}
{Norton, MA}{}
{
  Leaded a major factorization of the text analysis software 
  \href{https://github.com/WheatonCS/Lexos}{Lexos}.
  In the process, I implemented modern software development workflows and
  transitioned the code base to a functional-first paradigm for ease of maintenance.
  I have also proposed a new architecture for side-effect management in Python.

{My researches focus on algebraic methods in program verifications.
Currently, I am studying various extensions of Kleene Algebra, 
and how they can be used to model program semantics and logics.\\
My researches can provide easier proofs for correctness/incorrectness of program,
and can potentially automate these proofs.
