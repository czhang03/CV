% \section{Research Projects}

% \cventry{2024}
% {A Symbolic Decision Procedure For Guarded Kleene Algebra With Tests}
% {}{}{}
% {Guarded Kleene Algebra With Tests is an efficient framework for program verifications. In this work, we marry GKAT with symbolic automaton, further improving its efficiency.
% Unlike previous works with KAT, our algorithm was able to offload the solving of complex boolean logic to a fast external solver like z3.
% This work also gives the exact complexity bound of GKAT.}

% \cventry{2024}
% {Guarded Kleene Algebra With Tests And Control Flow Verification}
% {}{}{}
% {Correctness of compilation and decompilation remains a challenging step in producing fully verified software. 
% One of the difficulties is caused by the increasingly complex algorithm used for efficient control flow restructuring.
% In this work, we designed an algorithm to automatically verify the correctness control-flow restructuring. This algorithm is not only sound and complete with regard to trace equivalences, but also able to handle a wide range of control-flow structures like goto, break, return, and indicator variables. 
% Furthermore, we provide a preliminary implementation, and experiments. As part of our experiments, we were able to verify random programs with millions of command in seconds, while running on a laptop.}

% \cventry{2022 --- 2024}
% {Kleene Algebra With Commutative Hypothesis}
% {}{}{}
% {Researchers has long known the importance of commutative hypothesis in Kleene Algebra.
% However, with recent work, commutative hypothesis was put on the center stage as the foundation of relational verifications. 
% Unfortunately, the theory of KA with commutativity hypothesis is not as well-developed as its applications. 
% Specifically, the decidability of Kleene algebra with commutativity hypothesis has remained open for almost three decades.
% In this work, we took on this long-standing open problem, and proven that the Kleene Algebra with commutativity hypothesis is undecidable.
% In fact, we were able to obtain our undecidability result with only the left unfolding rule, and omitted induction rules. This means a large class of theories sitting between idempotent semiring with left unfolding, and the regular languages are all undecidable with commutativity hypothesis.}

% \cventry{2021 --- 2022}
% {Probabilistic Incorrectness Logic and Kleene Algebra}
% {}{}{}
% {Examine the mathematical foundation of probabilistic Incorrectness logic.
% This work may give rise to a method reason about correctness and incorrectness in probabilistic programs.}

% \cventry{2020 --- 2022}
% {Algebraic Formulation Of Incorrectness Logic}
% {}{}{}
% {Provide an algebraic formulation of Incorrectness Logic in TopKAT.
% Our work leads to simpler proofs for program incorrectness, 
% and demonstrates ways to automatically certify bugs in programs.
% We showed that TopKAT is a minimal framework to model incorrectness,
% as it is impossible to encode incorrectness logic in KAT.
% After that, we proved many meta-theoretical property of TopKAT,
% including incompleteness with relational model, 
% completeness of general relational model and language model, 
% complexity of deciding equality, and expressivity of general relational model.
% }

% \cventry{2017 --- 2018}
% {Mathematics Honor Thesis}
% {Wheaton College} {Norton, MA}{}
% {Studied kings in generalizations of tournament,
% with a special focus on quasi-transitive oriented graphs.
% I have shown that all the quasi-transitive oriented graphs
% can be condensed into a tournament via tie component condensation, 
% and tie component condensation of quasi-transitive 
% oriented graphs is the most efficient condensation to tournament.

% {Software Lead}
% {Lexomics Research Group, Wheaton College}
% {Norton, MA}{}
% {
%   Led a group of undergraduate engineers through a major factorization of 
%   the natrual language processing (NLP) software 
%   \href{https://github.com/WheatonCS/Lexos}{Lexos}.
%   In the process, 
%   I have designed a new architecture for side-effect management,
%   transitioned the code base to a scalable functional-first paradigm,
%   implemented industry-standard software development workflows,
%   and provided detailed documentations and guides for the entire system.
